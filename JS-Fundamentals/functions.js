//! Functions

// Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.

// For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere else.

// Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

// We’ve already seen examples of built-in functions, like alert(message), prompt(message, default) and confirm(question). But we can create functions of our own as well.
