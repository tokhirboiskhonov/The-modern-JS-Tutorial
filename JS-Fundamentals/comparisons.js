// We know many comparison operators from maths.

// In JS they are written like this:

//? 1. Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.
//? 2. Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.
//? 3. Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment.
//? 4. Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.
