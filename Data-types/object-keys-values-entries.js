//* Object.keys, values, entries

// Letâ€™s step away from the individual  data structures and talk about the iterations over them.

// In the previous chapter we saw methods map.keys(), map.values(), map.entries().

// These methods are generic, there is a common agreement to use them for data structures. If we ever create a data structure of our own, we should implement them too.

// They are supported for:

//? Map
//? Set
//? Array

// Plain objects also support similar methods, but the syntax is a bit different.
