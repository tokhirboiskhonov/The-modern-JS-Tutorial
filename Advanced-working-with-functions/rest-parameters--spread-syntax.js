//* Rest parameters and spread syntax

// Many JavaScript built-in functions support an arbitrary number of arguments.

// For instance:

//? Math.max(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) – returns the greatest of the arguments.
//? Object.assign(dest, src1, ..., srcN) – copies properties from src1..N into dest.
//? …and so on.

// In this chapter we’ll learn how to do the same. And also, how to pass arrays to such functions as parameters.
