//* Destructuring assignment

// The two most used data structures in JavaScript are Object and Array.

// Objects allow us to create a single entity that stores data items by key.

// Arrays allow us to gather data items into an ordered list.

// However, when we pass these to a function, we may not need all of it. The function might only require certain elements or properties.

// Destructuring assignment is a special syntax that allows us to “unpack” arrays or objects into a bunch of variables, as sometimes that’s more convenient.

// Destructuring also works well with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on. Soon we’ll see that.

//* Array destructuring

// Here's an example of how an array is destructured into variables:

let arr = ["John", "Smith"];

// destructuring assignment
// sets firstName = arr[0]
// and surname = arr[1]
let [firstName, lastName] = arr;

console.log(firstName); //John
console.log(lastName); //Smith

// Now we can work with variables instead of array members.

// It looks great when combined with split or other array-returning methods:

let [currentName, surname] = "John Smith".split(" ");

console.log(currentName); // John
console.log(surname); // Smith

// As you can see, the syntax is simple. There are several peculiar details though. Let’s see more examples to understand it better.
