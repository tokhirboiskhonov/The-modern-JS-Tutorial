//* Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval

// We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a certain time later. That’s called “scheduling a call”.

//! There are two methods for it:

//? 1. setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.
//? 2. setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

// These methods are not a part of JavaScript specification. But most environments have the internal scheduler and provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js.
