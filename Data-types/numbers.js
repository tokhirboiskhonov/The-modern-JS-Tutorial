//* Numbers

// In modern JavaScript, there are two types of numbers:

//? 1. Regular numbers in JavaScript are stored in 64-bit format IEEE-754, also known as “double precision floating point numbers”. These are numbers that we’re using most of the time, and we’ll talk about them in this chapter.

//? 2. BigInt numbers represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed because a regular integer number can’t safely exceed (253-1) or be less than -(253-1), as we mentioned earlier in the chapter Data types. As bigints are used in few special areas, we devote them a special chapter BigInt.

// So here we’ll talk about regular numbers. Let’s expand our knowledge of them.
