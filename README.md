# The-modern-JS-Tutorial

1. I'm starting to learn JS from javascript.info website (https://javascript.info/)
2. Here I'll share my own JS knowledges, which are getting from the website.

# Hello world

1. So you can write JS code using 2 ways, first one is the "script" tag, second one is <i>External scripts</i>.
   1.1 If we have a few JS code, you can put it into a <script></script> tag.
   1.2 If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file. Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute:
   1. <script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
      We can give a full URL as well. For instance:
   2. <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
