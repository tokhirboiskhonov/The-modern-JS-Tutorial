//* Symbol type

// By specification, only two primitive types may serve as object property keys:

// string type, or symbol type.

// Otherwise, if one uses another type, such as number, it’s autoconverted to string. So that obj[1] is the same as obj["1"], and obj[true] is the same as obj["true"].

// Until now we’ve been using only strings.

// Now let’s explore symbols, see what they can do for us.
