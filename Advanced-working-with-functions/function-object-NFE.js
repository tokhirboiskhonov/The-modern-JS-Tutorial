//* Function object, NFE

// As we already know, a function in JavaScript is a value.

// Every value in JavaScript has a type. What type is a function?

// In JavaScript, functions are objects.

// A good way to imagine functions is as callable “action objects”. We can not only call them, but also treat them as objects: add/remove properties, pass by reference etc.
