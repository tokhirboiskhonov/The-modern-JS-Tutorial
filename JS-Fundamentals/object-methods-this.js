//* Object methods, "this"

// Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on:

// let user = {
//   name: "John",
//   age: 24,
// };

// And, in the real world, a user can act: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.

// Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.
