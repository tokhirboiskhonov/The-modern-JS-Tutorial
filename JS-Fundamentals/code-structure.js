// Code Structure

// The first thing you will study is the building blocks of code.

// Semicolons
// A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.

// This would also work:

// alert("Hello")
// alert("World")

// In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!
