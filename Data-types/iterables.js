//* Iterables

// Iterable objects are a generalization of arrays. That’s a concept that allows us to make any object useable in a for..of loop.

// Of course, Arrays are iterable. But there are many other built-in objects, that are iterable as well. For instance, strings are also iterable.

// If an object isn’t technically an array, but represents a collection (list, set) of something, then for..of is a great syntax to loop over it, so let’s see how to make it work.
