//* Destructuring assignment

// The two most used data structures in JavaScript are Object and Array.

// Objects allow us to create a single entity that stores data items by key.

// Arrays allow us to gather data items into an ordered list.

// However, when we pass these to a function, we may not need all of it. The function might only require certain elements or properties.

// Destructuring assignment is a special syntax that allows us to “unpack” arrays or objects into a bunch of variables, as sometimes that’s more convenient.

// Destructuring also works well with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on. Soon we’ll see that.
