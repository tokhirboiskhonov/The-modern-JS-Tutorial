//! Conditional branching: if, '?'

// Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.

//* The "if" statement

// The if(...) statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is true, executes a block of code.

// For example:

// let year = +prompt(
//   "In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?",
//   ""
// );

// if (year == 2015) alert("You are right!");

// if we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:

// if (year == 2015) {
//   alert("That's correct!");
//   alert("You're so smart!");
// }
